### Hello! I hope you're doing well, and thanks for stopping by!

My name is Alicyn, and my pronouns are she/they/he.

I'm a student in Game Development with a minor in Sociology. I'm primarily learning C++ in school and quickly learning Python, Flask, and HTML/CSS/Javascript while working on the Monopoly repo. I also plan to learn Java in the near future!
