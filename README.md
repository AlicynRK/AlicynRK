### Hello! I hope you're doing well, and thanks for stopping by!

My name is Alicyn, and my pronouns are she/they/he.

I'm a student in Game Development with a minor in Sociology. I'm primarily learning C++ in school and quickly learning Python, Flask, JSON, and HTML/CSS/Javascript while working on the [Monopoly repo](https://github.com/NReedel/Monopoly). I'm also exploring web development, so you can see my first baby steps in my Firefox version of Chris's [Mirkwood Reader](https://github.com/AlicynRK/mirkwood-reader-firefox). In the future, I plan to learn Java to create some Minecraft mods and texture packs, which I'll upload here!
